- Coins will spawn every 13 seconds at a random location so be sure to pick 'em up by either walking over them or dragging them to your player. 

- Score gained from playing will make you level up and unlock new abilities.

- To find out what your abilities do and how to use 'em look at the instructions at the center bottom of the screen.
